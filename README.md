# Some inspirational quotes from some wise men to get motivated for research #
****
**Hennessy** \
Now, I was born in the gutter, facin' life or death \
I was a thug, ever since my mama gave me breath \
These motherfuckers wanna see me die, so who am I\
To try to warn 'em, I buck and bomb 'em, them niggas fry\
Hey, remember me? Down that Hennessy\
The nigga you don't wanna see, let me proceed\
My definition of some thug shit, y'all don't hear me\
Now that it's poppin, ain't no love, bitch\
I maintain in the game, in the gutter's where I still kick it
I'm trying to hustle up a meal ticket\
I'm still wicked in my ways, a hustler 'til my dyin' days\
Ain't nothin' wrong with gettin paid, so, nigga, blaze\
'Cause we some motherfuckin' fools\
Walkin through the streets wearing jewels\
Breakin' niggas, makin' moves\
Even the cops can't stop us, my enemies flip\
When they see me drink a fifth of that Hennessy   `--Tupac Shakur`

**Life lessons**\
About drinkin' straight out the eight bottle\
Do I look like a muthafuckin' role model?\
To a kid lookin' up to me\
Life ain't nothin' but bitches and money `--Ice Cube`
***
**Stay woke**\
Ey, Greta und der Klimaschutz (was?),\
 real Rap ich gib 'nen Fick auf Unser Klima, plus \
Ich gib 'nen Fick auf den Amazonas Regenwald\
Ich bin beschÃ¤ftigt mit anderen Problemen halt (yeah) `-- Money Boy`


# Git Basic Use #

**For optimal compatibility and easier and faster use, the following commands in this order should be helpful**: \
If no changes were made a pull command should be executed in the Terminal.
This ensures that the Version that you are working on is up to date.
```console
> git pull
```
If changes are present the progress should be safed 
and added to commit (staged)

```console
> git add .
```

the commit should be described
```console
> git commit -m"arbituary message that describes the change"

```
After staging, changes that may be present on the server should be pulled to avoid pushing changed files with merge conflicts on the main branch

```console
> git pull

```
Resolve the merge conflicts and push

```console
> git push

```
